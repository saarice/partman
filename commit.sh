CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES:
========================

Authentication Bypass Removal:
- Removed mock-jwt-token bypass from API authentication middleware
- API now requires valid JWT token for all protected routes
- Removed hardcoded 'mock-jwt-token-system-owner' from frontend code
- Frontend now retrieves tokens from localStorage (set during login)

Environment Variable Security:
- Created comprehensive environment validation system (validateEnv.ts)
- Server now fails-fast on startup if JWT_SECRET not set
- Added production-specific validation (no default secrets allowed)
- JWT_SECRET now required (removed default fallback)

Configuration Management:
- Updated .env.example with security documentation
- Added comment explaining how to generate secure random secret
- Created .env file with development keys
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent committing sensitive files

Files Modified:
- apps/api/src/middleware/authentication.ts: Removed Lines 37-47 (mock bypass)
- apps/web/src/js/opportunity-management.js: Real auth from localStorage
- apps/api/src/config/validateEnv.ts: NEW - Full env validation
- apps/api/src/server.ts: Added validation on startup
- apps/api/.env.example: Enhanced with security docs
- .gitignore: Added .env, .qa-bypass, logs

Security Status After This Commit:
✅ No authentication bypasses
✅ No hardcoded secrets in source code
✅ Environment validation enforced
✅ Production safety checks active
✅ All sensitive files in .gitignore

Impact:
- Breaking change: Developers MUST set JWT_SECRET in .env
- Improved security posture significantly
- Prevents accidental production deployment with defaults

Story: 11.2 - Remove Security Vulnerabilities
