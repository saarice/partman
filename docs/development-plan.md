## 4. Risk Mitigation and Contingency Planning

### High-Priority Risks

#### Risk 1: Commission Calculation Complexity
**Probability:** High (70%)
**Impact:** High
**Days at Risk:** Days 14-15, 19-20

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Pre-Sprint:** Detailed audit of all partner agreements (2 days before Sprint 2)
- **During Development:** Create test scenarios for all commission models
- **Contingency:** Manual override system for complex cases
- **Buffer Time:** Add 1 day buffer for commission engine in Sprint 2

**Early Warning Signs:**
- More than 3 different commission models discovered
- Edge cases not covered by initial design
- Finance team identifies calculation errors

#### Risk 2: Performance Issues with Dashboard
**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** Medium
**Days at Risk:** Days 19-20, 26-27

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Pre-Sprint:** Load testing plan preparation
- **During Development:** Performance monitoring from day 1
- **Contingency:** Redis caching implementation for slow queries
- **Buffer Time:** 1 day allocated for performance optimization

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Dashboard load times >3 seconds
- Database queries >200ms average
- Real-time updates causing lag

#### Risk 3: Team Adoption Resistance
**Probability:** Medium (50%)
**Impact:** High
**Days at Risk:** Throughout development, critical at launch

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Weekly:** VP feedback sessions every Friday

- **Change Management:** Involve team in UI design decisions
- **Training Plan:** Hands-on training sessions planned for week 6

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Negative feedback from demo sessions
- UI complexity complaints
- Long status update times in testing

### Contingency Plans

#### If Development Falls Behind Schedule

**Week 1-2 Behind:**
- Move alert system to post-MVP
- Simplify executive dashboard to basic KPIs only
- Use basic HTML forms instead of rich UI components

**Week 3-4 Behind:**
- Reduce commission structure complexity
- Simplify pipeline analytics to basic lists
- Defer real-time updates to post-MVP

**Week 5-6 Behind:**
- Launch with manual task management
- Simplify production deployment
- Plan post-launch feature additions

#### If Technical Blockers Occur

**Database Performance Issues:**
- Implement aggressive caching with Redis
- Optimize queries with database consultant
- Consider read-replica for reporting queries

**Frontend Performance Issues:**
- Implement lazy loading for all components
- Reduce dashboard complexity
- Add pagination to all lists

**Integration Complexity:**
- Build simpler REST interfaces
