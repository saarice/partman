## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Enhanced user management tables
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'suspended', 'pending') DEFAULT 'pending',
  last_login TIMESTAMPTZ,
  password_changed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  locked_until TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  is_system_role BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  permissions JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE user_roles (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)
);

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  resource_type VARCHAR(100),
  resource_id UUID,
  old_values JSONB,
  new_values JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Permission System Architecture
```javascript
// Permission categories and actions
const PERMISSIONS = {
  PARTNERS: ['read', 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'manage_commissions'],
  OPPORTUNITIES: ['read', 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'change_stage', 'assign'],
  COMMISSIONS: ['read', 'calculate', 'approve', 'export'],
  REPORTS: ['read', 'create', 'export', 'admin_reports'],
  USERS: ['read', 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'manage_roles'],
  SYSTEM: ['settings', 'logs', 'backups', 'impersonate']
};

// Predefined roles with permissions
const SYSTEM_ROLES = {
  SYSTEM_OWNER: { permissions: 'ALL', description: 'Complete system access' },
  VP_STRATEGIC_PARTNERSHIPS: {
    permissions: ['PARTNERS.*', 'OPPORTUNITIES.*', 'COMMISSIONS.*', 'REPORTS.*', 'USERS.read,create,update'],
    description: 'Full business operations access'
  },
  SALES_MANAGER: {
    permissions: ['OPPORTUNITIES.*', 'PARTNERS.read', 'COMMISSIONS.read,calculate', 'REPORTS.read,export'],
    description: 'Sales operations and reporting'
  },
  PARTNERSHIP_MANAGER: {
    permissions: ['PARTNERS.*', 'OPPORTUNITIES.read,create,update', 'COMMISSIONS.read', 'REPORTS.read'],
    description: 'Partner relationship management'
  },
  SALES_REP: {
    permissions: ['OPPORTUNITIES.read,create,update', 'PARTNERS.read', 'COMMISSIONS.read'],
    description: 'Individual sales activities'
  },
  READ_ONLY: {
    permissions: ['*.read'],
    description: 'View-only access to all data'
  }
};
```

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication system enhancement
- Database schema migrations
- API security middleware updates
- Frontend route protection implementation

## Success Metrics
- 100% of team members successfully onboarded with appropriate access
- Zero unauthorized access incidents
- 95% user satisfaction with self-service capabilities
- Complete audit trail coverage for compliance requirements
- Average user onboarding time < 15 minutes

## Risk Considerations
- **Permission Complexity**: Granular permissions may become overly complex
- **User Experience**: Too many restrictions may impact productivity
- **Migration Risk**: Existing users must be migrated without losing access
- **Security vs Usability**: Balance between security and ease of use

## Implementation Notes
- Implement role-based access control middleware for all API endpoints
- Create comprehensive permission testing strategy
- Design intuitive user management interface for administrators
- Consider implementing approval workflows for sensitive role changes
- Plan for future integration with external authentication systems (SSO, LDAP)
