# Risks & Mitigation

## High-Impact Risks

**Risk**: Google OAuth API complexity may cause delays
**Mitigation**: Allocate buffer time (Week 5 for integration), use Google OAuth Playground for testing, keep email/password as fallback

**Risk**: Email delivery failures prevent user registration
**Mitigation**: Use SendGrid (99.9% deliverability SLA), implement 3-retry logic with exponential backoff, admin can resend invitations manually

**Risk**: Database migration failures block deployment
**Mitigation**: Test migrations on staging first, backup production database, use transactions with automatic rollback, implement dry-run mode

## Medium-Impact Risks

**Risk**: Scope creep extends timeline indefinitely
**Mitigation**: Strict adherence to 16 defined user stories, defer nice-to-haves (Microsoft OAuth, 2FA, magic links) to Phase 4, weekly progress review

**Risk**: Performance issues at scale (1000+ users)
**Mitigation**: Implement pagination (50 users per page), add database indexes on search fields, load test before production
