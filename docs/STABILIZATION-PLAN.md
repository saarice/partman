# Partnership Management Platform - Stabilization Plan
## Phase 1: Minimal Working Product ‚Üí Production Ready

**Goal**: Fix everything that exists, make it work flawlessly, polish the UI, then go to production.

**Philosophy**: Better to have 3 features that work perfectly than 10 features that are broken.

---

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Kanban drag-and-drop** (recently fixed, QA: PASS)
- **Opportunity management core** - Add/Edit/Delete opportunities
- **Filter system** - Partner, assignee, value, date, search
- **Multiple views** - Kanban, Table, Analytics (with charts)
- **Sample data loading** - 20 opportunities across all stages
- **Commission preview** - Basic calculation in opportunity modal
- **Pipeline counts** - Real-time updates after drag operations
- **Export functionality** - CSV export of pipeline data

### üü° Partially Working / Has Issues
1. **React vs Vanilla JS Confusion**
   - Multiple App components (App.tsx, AppSimple.tsx, AppWorking.tsx, TestApp.tsx)
   - Opportunities page exists in BOTH React (`OpportunitiesPage.tsx`) AND vanilla HTML (`opportunities-enterprise.html`)
   - Unclear which is the "real" entry point

2. **Authentication**
   - No JWT implementation
   - No login flow working
   - Routes exist but no actual security

3. **API Integration**
   - Frontend uses sample data (not calling real API)
   - API exists but frontend doesn't connect to it
   - No error handling for failed API calls

4. **Database**
   - Migrations exist but no verification they're running
   - Sample data in API, but also in frontend (duplication)
   - No clear data flow

5. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Modal positioning (recently fixed, but needs verification)
   - Inconsistent styling across pages
   - No loading states
   - No error messages for users
   - Forms don't validate properly

6. **Navigation**
   - Sidebar nav exists but integration unclear
   - Breadcrumbs hardcoded
   - No active state indication

### ‚ùå Broken / Not Working
1. **User Management** (Story 6.x)
   - Components exist but not integrated
   - No working CRUD for users
   - Role management incomplete

2. **Partner Management** (Story 2.1)
   - Components exist but minimal functionality
   - No relationship health tracking working
   - Commission structures not configurable

3. **Dashboard** (Story 1.1)
   - Components exist but data not wired up
   - Real-time updates not working
   - KPIs showing sample data only

4. **Docker Infrastructure**
   - docker-compose.yml location unclear
   - No documented startup procedure
   - Database initialization unclear

## Stabilization Plan - Execution Order

### **PHASE 1: Architecture Clarity** (2-3 days)
**Objective**: Decide what stays, what goes, make one coherent system

#### 1.1 Choose Architecture Path ‚úÖ CRITICAL
- **DECISION REQUIRED**: React SPA or Vanilla JS?
  - Option A: Full React (use apps/web/src, kill HTML pages)
  - Option B: Hybrid (React for dashboard/admin, vanilla for opportunities)
  - Option C: Full Vanilla JS (kill React, use HTML pages)

**Recommendation**: Option A (Full React)
- Already have React infrastructure
- Easier to maintain long-term
- Better for adding features later

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Delete duplicate app files (AppSimple.tsx, AppWorking.tsx, TestApp.tsx)
- [ ] Keep ONE App.tsx as main entry
- [ ] Convert `opportunities-enterprise.html` functionality into React component
- [ ] Remove vanilla JS files that duplicate React functionality
- [ ] Update package.json scripts to reflect single approach

#### 1.2 Consolidate Entry Points ‚úÖ CRITICAL
- [ ] One main.tsx file
- [ ] One App.tsx with proper routing
- [ ] Clear component structure
- [ ] Document the architecture in README

#### 1.3 Fix Docker Infrastructure ‚úÖ CRITICAL
- [ ] Move docker-compose.yml to root (if not there)
- [ ] Test `docker-compose up` works cleanly
- [ ] Verify database initializes with migrations
- [ ] Verify API connects to database
- [ ] Document startup procedure in README
