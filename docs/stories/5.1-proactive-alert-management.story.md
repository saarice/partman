# User Story 5.1: Proactive Alert Management

## Story Details
**Epic**: Alerts and Notification System
**Story ID**: 5.1
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 8

## User Story
**As a** VP Strategic Partnerships
**I want** comprehensive alert system for critical business events
**So that** I can take proactive action on opportunities, relationships, and goals

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Opportunity-based alerts (stage stagnation, close date approaching, high-value changes)
- [ ] Relationship maintenance alerts based on last interaction timing
- [ ] Goal milestone alerts (75% progress, behind schedule, achievement)
- [ ] Task overdue alerts with escalation to managers
- [ ] Commission calculation alerts for review and approval
- [ ] Configurable alert thresholds and timing preferences
- [ ] Multiple notification channels (in-app, email, Slack integration future)
- [ ] Alert acknowledgment and action tracking

## Alert Categories
- **Opportunity Alerts**:
  - Stage stagnation (no movement >14 days)
  - Close date approaching (<7 days)
  - High-value deal changes (>$50K value modifications)
  - Probability drops (>25% decrease)

- **Relationship Alerts**:
  - Maintenance overdue (>30 days no contact for strategic partners)
  - Health score declining (drops below healthy threshold)
  - Partner satisfaction survey due
  - Relationship review meetings overdue

- **Goal Alerts**:
  - Milestone achievement (75%, 90%, 100% completion)
  - Behind schedule (>10% behind target pace)
  - Goal deadline approaching (<30 days)
  - Performance anomalies (significant deviation from trend)

## Technical Requirements
- Event-driven alert system with configurable triggers
- Multi-channel notification engine (in-app, email, future integrations)
- Alert configuration interface for threshold management
- Acknowledgment and action tracking system
- Alert escalation logic based on urgency and role

## Alert Timing Configuration
- **Immediate**: Critical alerts requiring instant attention
- **Daily Digest**: Summary of non-critical alerts sent daily
- **Weekly Summary**: Comprehensive alert summary for planning
- **Custom**: User-defined frequency and timing preferences
