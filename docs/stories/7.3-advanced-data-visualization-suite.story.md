## Technical Requirements

### Visualization Technology Stack
- **Chart.js 4.x**: Primary charting library with custom executive themes
- **D3.js**: Advanced custom visualizations and interactive elements
- **React Chart.js 2**: React integration for Chart.js components
- **Framer Motion**: Animation and transition effects

### Advanced Chart Components
```typescript
interface AdvancedChartProps {
  data: ChartDataPoint[];
  type: 'funnel' | 'heatmap' | 'sankey' | 'waterfall' | 'network';
  interactive?: boolean;
  exportable?: boolean;
  theme?: 'light' | 'dark' | 'executive';
  animations?: boolean;
  onDataPointClick?: (data: ChartDataPoint) => void;
  customTooltip?: (data: ChartDataPoint) => React.ReactNode;
}
```

### Real-time Data Integration
- WebSocket integration for live data updates
- Efficient data transformation and caching strategies
- Progressive data loading for large datasets
- Optimistic updates with fallback mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Canvas-based rendering for complex visualizations
- Virtual scrolling for large data tables
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Memory management for real-time updates
