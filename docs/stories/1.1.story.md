- Models: apps/api/src/models/ (shared with other services)

**Frontend Files**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L10-55]
- Page: apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard/
- Components: apps/web/src/components/dashboard/KPICards/, PipelineFunnel/, TeamPerformance/
- Hooks: apps/web/src/hooks/useDashboard.ts (custom hook for data fetching)

**Shared Types**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L113-118]
- packages/shared/src/types/api.ts (API request/response types)
- packages/shared/src/types/opportunity.ts, partner.ts, user.ts

### Technical Constraints
**Authentication**: JWT + organization context required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L10]
- All dashboard routes must validate JWT tokens and set organization context
- Organization filtering must be applied to all database queries

**Configuration-First Development**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L5]
- Dashboard behavior (refresh intervals, KPI definitions) must check configuration first
- Organization-specific dashboard settings stored in configurations table

**Performance Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L15]
- Redis caching for dashboard data (TTL: 5 minutes)
- PostgreSQL JSONB queries optimized for KPI aggregation
- Sub-2-second load time requirement (AC: 6)

**Multi-tenant Isolation**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L6]
- Row Level Security (RLS) for all database queries
- Organization context must be set for every database operation

### Testing Standards
**Test Organization**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L13-47]
- Frontend tests: apps/web/tests/components/Dashboard/
- Backend tests: apps/api/tests/controllers/dashboardController.test.ts, services/dashboardService.test.ts
- Integration tests: apps/api/tests/integration/dashboard.integration.test.ts

**Testing Frameworks**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L10-12]
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API and service tests
- E2E: Cypress for end-to-end dashboard workflow testing

**Test Requirements**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L128-194]
- Mock configuration service for dashboard behavior testing
- Test data fixtures for consistent KPI calculations
- WebSocket testing for real-time update functionality
- Performance testing for sub-2-second load time validation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**: While the frontend dashboard components and API structure are well-implemented, the story cannot function due to missing database schema. The dashboard API consistently returns 500 errors because required tables (opportunities, partners, users, alerts) do not exist in the database.

**Frontend Implementation**: Excellent component structure with proper React patterns, Material-UI integration, and good separation of concerns. Dashboard layout meets design requirements.

**Backend Implementation**: Well-structured service layer and controller with proper TypeScript interfaces, but all database queries fail due to missing tables.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed due to fundamental database schema issues that must be resolved first.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows established patterns and TypeScript conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized according to architecture guidelines
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing backend API tests completely
- All ACs Met: ✗ Only AC #7 (responsive design) partially functional

### Improvements Checklist

**CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Production:**
- [ ] Create database schema migrations for opportunities, partners, users, alerts tables
- [ ] Execute migrations to establish required database structure
- [ ] Fix API error handling for missing data scenarios
- [ ] Create comprehensive backend test suite (dashboardService.test.ts, dashboardController.test.ts)

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- [ ] Implement WebSocket real-time updates (AC #5)
- [ ] Add Redis caching for performance optimization (AC #6)
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in frontend for API failures
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete dashboard workflow

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- [ ] Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when data is unavailable
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for API performance

### Security Review

**CONCERNS IDENTIFIED:**
- JWT authentication properly implemented but no rate limiting on endpoints
- Database queries vulnerable to errors due to missing schema validation
- No input sanitization for query parameters

### Performance Considerations

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
- Cannot meet AC #6 (2-second load time) due to API failures
- No caching layer implemented as specified in requirements
- Missing database indices for performance optimization

### Files Modified During Review

None - database schema issues prevent meaningful code improvements.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-vp-dashboard-overview.yml

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Production deployment would result in complete feature failure

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical database and testing gaps must be addressed**

**Next Steps:**
1. Create database schema migrations immediately
2. Execute migrations in development environment
3. Verify API functionality with proper data
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Re-submit for QA review
