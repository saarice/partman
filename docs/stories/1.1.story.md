  - [ ] Add frontend WebSocket client for live updates
- [ ] Optimize performance and responsiveness (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Implement Redis caching for dashboard data
  - [ ] Add responsive design with Material-UI breakpoints
  - [ ] Optimize database queries for sub-2-second load times

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story implementation.

### Data Models
**Quarterly Goals**: Track revenue targets and progress [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L147-162]
- Fields: organizationId, quarter, year, goal_type ('revenue'), target_value, current_value
- Unique constraint on (organizationId, user_id, quarter, year, goal_type)

**Opportunities**: Pipeline and revenue data source [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L129-180]
- Key fields: organizationId, partnerId, dealValue, stage, probability, status
- Commission details stored in JSONB for flexible calculations
- Stage progression tracked in opportunity_stage_history table

**Partners**: Relationship health and commission data [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L76-128]
- relationshipHealth: 0-100 calculated score for health indicators
- commissionStructure: JSONB with flexible commission configuration
- primaryContact and agreementDetails for relationship tracking

**Users**: Team member performance tracking [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L182-229]
- Role-based permissions for dashboard access
- personalSettings: JSONB for dashboard customization preferences

### API Specifications
**Dashboard KPI Endpoint**: GET /dashboard/kpis [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#L319-369]
- Query parameter: period (current_quarter, last_quarter, ytd)
- Returns: revenueProgress, pipelineHealth, teamPerformance objects
- Authentication required with organization context

**Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration [Source: architecture/components.md#L50-54]
- Redis for dashboard caching and real-time pipeline updates
- WebSocket.io for broadcasting KPI changes to connected clients

### Component Specifications
**Frontend Architecture**: React + Material-UI + Zustand [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L14-30]
- Dashboard components: KPICards, PipelineFunnel, TeamPerformance
- Location: apps/web/src/components/dashboard/
- Page location: apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard/
- State management: Zustand store for dashboard data

**API Client**: Axios with organization context [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L218-293]
- Automatic JWT token attachment and organization header
- Base URL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL or localhost:8000/api/v1
- Timeout: 10000ms with automatic retry on 401

### File Locations
**Backend Files**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L56-101]
- Service: apps/api/src/services/dashboardService.ts
- Controller: apps/api/src/controllers/dashboardController.ts
- Routes: apps/api/src/routes/dashboard.ts
- Models: apps/api/src/models/ (shared with other services)

**Frontend Files**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L10-55]
- Page: apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard/
- Components: apps/web/src/components/dashboard/KPICards/, PipelineFunnel/, TeamPerformance/
- Hooks: apps/web/src/hooks/useDashboard.ts (custom hook for data fetching)
- Services: apps/web/src/services/dashboardService.ts (API client methods)

**Shared Types**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L113-118]
- packages/shared/src/types/api.ts (API request/response types)
- packages/shared/src/types/opportunity.ts, partner.ts, user.ts

### Technical Constraints
**Authentication**: JWT + organization context required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L10]
- All dashboard routes must validate JWT tokens and set organization context
- Organization filtering must be applied to all database queries

**Configuration-First Development**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L5]
- Dashboard behavior (refresh intervals, KPI definitions) must check configuration first
- Organization-specific dashboard settings stored in configurations table

**Performance Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L15]
- Redis caching for dashboard data (TTL: 5 minutes)
- PostgreSQL JSONB queries optimized for KPI aggregation
- Sub-2-second load time requirement (AC: 6)

**Multi-tenant Isolation**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L6]
- Row Level Security (RLS) for all database queries
- Organization context must be set for every database operation

### Testing Standards
**Test Organization**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L13-47]
- Frontend tests: apps/web/tests/components/Dashboard/
- Backend tests: apps/api/tests/controllers/dashboardController.test.ts, services/dashboardService.test.ts
- Integration tests: apps/api/tests/integration/dashboard.integration.test.ts

**Testing Frameworks**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L10-12]
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API and service tests
- E2E: Cypress for end-to-end dashboard workflow testing

**Test Requirements**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L128-194]
- Mock configuration service for dashboard behavior testing
- Test data fixtures for consistent KPI calculations
- WebSocket testing for real-time update functionality
- Performance testing for sub-2-second load time validation
