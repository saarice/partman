# User Story 5.2: Alert Prioritization and Management

## Story Details
**Epic**: Alerts and Notification System
**Story ID**: 5.2
**Priority**: Medium
**Points**: 5

## User Story
**As a** Team Member
**I want** prioritized alert system with clear action guidance
**So that** I can focus on highest-impact activities and maintain performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Priority-based alert sorting (urgent, high, medium, low)
- [ ] Alert categorization by type and entity
- [ ] Bulk alert management (mark read, dismiss, archive)
- [ ] Alert action recommendations with direct links to relevant sections
- [ ] Alert frequency controls to prevent notification overload
- [ ] Historical alert analysis for pattern identification
- [ ] Custom alert rules based on user role and responsibilities

## Priority Levels
- **Urgent** (Red): Immediate action required, business impact
  - High-value deal changes, critical deadlines, system failures
- **High** (Orange): Action needed within 24 hours
  - Opportunity stagnation, relationship maintenance, goal deadlines
- **Medium** (Yellow): Action needed within 1 week
  - Task overdue, routine maintenance, performance metrics
- **Low** (Blue): Informational or long-term planning
  - Achievements, trend notifications, system updates

## Alert Management Features
- **Smart Sorting**: Automatic priority-based ordering with time sensitivity
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple alerts for mass actions
- **Quick Actions**: One-click acknowledgment, dismissal, or escalation
- **Action Guidance**: Contextual recommendations for alert resolution

## Technical Requirements
- Priority calculation algorithm based on urgency and business impact
- Bulk operations interface with efficient backend processing
- Smart recommendations engine for action guidance
- Historical alert analytics and pattern recognition
- User preference system for notification frequency control

## Alert Categorization
- **By Type**: Opportunity, Relationship, Goal, Task, System
- **By Entity**: Specific partners, deals, team members, or projects
- **By Source**: Which system module generated the alert
- **By Status**: New, acknowledged, in progress, resolved, dismissed

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Priority-based alert sorting operational with visual indicators
- [ ] Alert categorization by all specified dimensions working
- [ ] Bulk alert management interface functional and efficient
- [ ] Action recommendations with direct navigation implemented
- [ ] Frequency controls preventing notification overload
- [ ] Historical alert analysis and pattern identification operational
- [ ] Custom alert rules configuration per user role
- [ ] Smart filtering and search capabilities across alerts
- [ ] Performance optimized for users with 100+ alerts
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged

## Custom Rules Engine
- **Role-Based**: Different alert types based on user role and permissions
- **Threshold Customization**: Personal preferences for alert sensitivity
- **Schedule-Based**: Different alert behavior during business hours vs. off-hours
- **Context-Aware**: Alert relevance based on current projects and responsibilities

## Dependencies
