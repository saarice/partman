### Debug Log References
- Initial analysis of existing auth system completed
- Found basic JWT authentication with simple role field
- Need to enhance to support granular permissions

### Completion Notes
- Building on existing JWT authentication system
- Will implement comprehensive role-based access control
- Focus on system owner capabilities and audit trail

### Change Log

- [2024-12-15] Analysis of existing authentication system completed

## Notes
- System Owner should have ultimate authority over all system functions
- Implement safeguards to prevent accidental system lockout
- Ensure all administrative actions are logged for compliance
- Consider implementing approval workflows for critical changes
