## Quick Start

### For Product Owner
```bash
# Review epic and prioritize stories
cat docs/epics/epic-11-production-readiness-technical-debt.md

# Plan sprint
# - Week 1: Stories 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 (16 points)
# - Week 2: Stories 11.4, 11.5, 11.6 (42 points)
```

### For Developers
```bash
# Start with Story 11.1 (highest priority)
cat docs/stories/11.1-fix-broken-test-suite.story.md

# Implement fix
# Run tests
npm run test

# Move to Story 11.2
cat docs/stories/11.2-remove-security-vulnerabilities.story.md
```

## Risk Summary

### High Risk Items
1. **Test writing time underestimated** (40% probability)
   - Mitigation: Start with highest-value tests
   - Accept 60% coverage as MVP (not 80%)

2. **Breaking changes during refactoring** (30% probability)
   - Mitigation: Write tests BEFORE refactoring
   - Use feature flags for risky changes

3. **API response structure mismatches** (60% probability)
   - Mitigation: Validate with TypeScript + Zod
   - Test with actual database data early

### Medium Risk Items
- Database migration complexity
- Performance issues with real data
- Team velocity slower than estimated

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standup Focus
- Which story are you working on?
- Any blockers?
- Tests passing?
- Coverage increasing?

### Weekly Demo
- Show working features with real data
- Demonstrate test coverage improvements
- Review security improvements

### Sprint Review
- Week 1: Deployment blockers removed âœ…
- Week 2: Production foundation complete âœ…
- Week 3: Automation working âœ…
- Week 4: Launch readiness âœ…
