# Story 9.1: Navigation Framework Restructure

**Story ID**: 9.1
**Epic**: 9 - Information Architecture Restructure
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 5 Story Points

## Story
**As a** VP Strategic Partnerships
**I want** the primary navigation clearly separated into "Dashboards" and "Management" sections
**So that** I can intuitively distinguish between viewing analytics versus managing business operations

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Primary sidebar navigation displays two distinct sections with visual grouping
2. Dashboards section contains: Overall, Opportunities, Partnerships, Financial dashboards
3. Management section contains: Opportunity Management, Partnership Management
4. Navigation maintains Epic 7 design system consistency and responsive behavior
5. All existing navigation functionality continues to work unchanged
