# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Partnership Management Platform, a configurable multi-tenant system for managing strategic partnerships, revenue tracking, and team oversight. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines frontend, backend, and infrastructure concerns with configuration-first design principles, enabling deployment for organizations of any size with customizable team structures, revenue targets, and partnership models.

## Starter Template Decision

**Selected Approach**: Custom Docker-based architecture with configuration-first design

**Rationale**:
- Enables complete control over multi-tenant configuration architecture
- Docker containerization provides deployment flexibility (local â†’ cloud)
- Custom design allows optimization for partnership management domain
- Supports future scaling to external sales/multi-customer scenarios

**Constraints**:
- Custom development required for all configuration management features
- Full responsibility for security and scalability patterns
- Longer initial development timeline compared to starter templates
