# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:;`
- XSS Prevention: Content Security Policy, input sanitization, output encoding
- Secure Storage: Sensitive data in httpOnly cookies, JWT tokens in memory only

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Joi schema validation for all API inputs with strict type checking
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP, 1000 per hour per authenticated user
- CORS Policy: Restrict to known frontend domains with credentials enabled

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: JWT in httpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict, 24-hour expiration
- Session Management: Redis-based sessions with automatic cleanup and session rotation
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements, bcrypt with 12 rounds

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <500KB compressed for main bundle, code splitting for routes
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading for routes, progressive loading for dashboard components
- Caching Strategy: Service worker for API responses, browser caching for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <200ms for API endpoints, <100ms for cached responses
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling, strategic indexes, query optimization
- Caching Strategy: Redis for configuration data (5-minute TTL), session caching, API response caching
