2. Strategic Goal & Competency Management (hyperscaler goals, competency renewals, service delivery)
3. Relationship Intelligence (heatmap of strength + opportunity value, alert system, bizdev prioritization)
4. Performance Management (department KPIs, individual KPIs, benchmark alerts)

**Insights Discovered:**
- Core platform purpose: "Strategic Partnership Resource Optimization Engine"
- Central question: "Given team capacity, which partnerships get attention this week/month?"
- Platform must answer multiple critical VP decisions simultaneously

**Notable Connections:**
- All four categories feed into the central optimization decision
- Performance management drives resource allocation
- Relationship intelligence informs prioritization

### What-If Scenarios - 25 minutes

**Description:** Explored AWS partnership complexity and funding workflow automation potential

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Track 100+ AWS contacts with relationship health
2. Automate MAP funding requests (up to $10M ARR)
3. Pipeline POA funding opportunities
4. MDF management workflows
5. Partner Central opportunity tracking
6. BOX program participation tracking
7. Competency maintenance automation

**Insights Discovered:**
- AWS ecosystem has significant complexity requiring systematic management
- Funding request automation could solve major operational bottlenecks
- Multiple AWS programs (MAP, POA, MDF, BOX) need unified tracking

**Notable Connections:**
- AWS complexity mirrors overall partnership platform needs
- Funding workflows connect directly to revenue pipeline
- Contact relationship health impacts funding success rates

### Morphological Analysis - 15 minutes

**Description:** Prioritized VP pain points to identify MVP focus

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Department visibility rated 5/5 priority
2. Pipeline oversight rated 5/5 priority
3. Goal tracking rated 4/5 priority
4. MVP focus determined: ISV Pipeline Tracker

**Insights Discovered:**
- Clear prioritization: Department visibility and pipeline oversight are critical
- MVP should solve immediate pain before expanding scope
- $250K quarterly ISV revenue target defines scope complexity

### Insights & Learnings

- **Start Simple Philosophy**: Complex platforms fail if MVP isn't proven first - Docker approach with step-by-step development is essential
- **Data Input Minimalism**: If team input process is too complex, platform won't get adopted even by internal team
- **Revenue Focus Validates Everything**: $250K quarterly target provides clear success metrics and justifies development investment
- **Relationship-Revenue Connection**: All partnership activities ultimately connect to revenue pipeline health and relationship maintenance

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

- **Next steps:** Define simple data model for 20+ ISV partners, create basic Docker container with web UI, implement commission calculation engine
- **Resources needed:** Developer (full-stack), PostgreSQL database, Docker hosting, basic UI framework
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for functional MVP

#### #2 Priority: Weekly Meeting Integration Workflow
- **Rationale:** Leverages existing team process as primary data source, ensures platform adoption through minimal change management
- **Next steps:** Design simple status update interface, create task rollover automation, implement basic goal tracking
- **Resources needed:** UI development, workflow automation logic, integration with MVP platform
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks post-MVP launch

#### #3 Priority: Commission Configuration System
- **Rationale:** Essential for accurate revenue forecasting and supports multiple partner models (referral, MSP, reseller, co-sell)
- **Next steps:** Design flexible commission model structure, implement calculation engine, create configuration interface
- **Resources needed:** Business logic development, configuration UI, testing across multiple partner scenarios
- **Timeline:** 3-4 weeks post-MVP launch

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- **Progressive technique approach** - Started broad, narrowed to specific MVP scope
- **VP perspective focus** - Maintained strategic level throughout while identifying operational needs
- **Revenue-driven prioritization** - $250K quarterly target provided clear decision framework
- **Complexity acknowledgment** - Recognized AWS ecosystem complexity while keeping MVP simple

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Team member workflows**: Need to understand individual team member daily workflows beyond weekly meetings

- **Technical architecture planning**: Design session for scalable Docker-based architecture
- **Revenue model analysis**: Deep dive into commission structures and partner agreement variations

### Questions That Emerged
- **What's the specific data model for ISV partner tracking?**
- **How should the platform handle different time zones for global partnerships?**
- **What reporting does executive leadership expect from this platform?**
- **How will success be measured beyond revenue tracking?**

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** Technical architecture design for MVP, detailed ISV partner data modeling, team member workflow mapping
- **Recommended timeframe:** 1-2 weeks (after MVP scope approval)
- **Preparation needed:** Gather current ISV partner agreement details, document existing team workflows, define technical requirements
