# QA Definition Methodology for Partnership Management Platform

## Executive Summary

This QA methodology ensures **zero regression** and **continuous quality** for your ISV Pipeline Tracker MVP managing $250K quarterly revenue across 20+ technology partners. Our approach provides **automated script checks** that prevent any new development from affecting your working platform.

## QA Philosophy & Principles

### Core Quality Principles
1. **Prevention Over Detection** - Quality gates catch issues before they impact production
2. **Risk-Based Testing** - Focus efforts on high-impact, high-probability failure scenarios
3. **Continuous Validation** - Automated checks run with every code change
4. **Business Impact Priority** - Test critical revenue and partnership workflows first
5. **Platform Stability** - Never compromise working functionality for new features

### Quality Definition Framework

**Quality = Functional Correctness + Performance + Security + Maintainability + User Experience**

Where each component is measured and validated through automated scripts.

## Quality Gate Methodology

### 3-Tier Quality Gate System

#### Tier 1: Commit Gates (Immediate)
**Trigger**: Every git commit
**Duration**: < 2 minutes
**Scope**: Unit tests, linting, basic security scans

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
set -e

echo "🔍 Running Tier 1 Quality Gates..."

# Code Quality
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Unit Tests
npm run test:unit

# Security Scan
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Performance Budget
npm run check:bundle-size

echo "✅ Tier 1 Gates Passed"
```

#### Tier 2: Integration Gates (PR/Branch)
**Trigger**: Pull request creation/update
**Duration**: < 10 minutes
**Scope**: Integration tests, API validation, database integrity

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/qa-tier2-gates.sh
set -e

echo "🧪 Running Tier 2 Quality Gates..."

# Database Tests
npm run test:db:reset
npm run test:integration

# API Contract Validation
npm run test:api-contracts

# Commission Calculation Verification
npm run test:commission-accuracy

# Performance Tests
npm run test:performance

echo "✅ Tier 2 Gates Passed"
```

#### Tier 3: Deployment Gates (Release)
**Trigger**: Deployment to production
**Duration**: < 30 minutes
**Scope**: E2E tests, load tests, regression suites

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/qa-tier3-gates.sh
set -e

echo "🚀 Running Tier 3 Quality Gates..."

# Full E2E Test Suite
npm run test:e2e

# Load Testing
npm run test:load

# Security Penetration Testing
npm run test:security

# Backup & Recovery Validation
