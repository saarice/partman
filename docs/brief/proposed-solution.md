# Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** A containerized Strategic Partnership Resource Optimization Engine that transforms scattered partnership data into actionable intelligence for VP-level decision making.

**Key Approach:**
- **Docker-First Architecture:** Simple deployment on local infrastructure with clean, focused UI
- **Pipeline-Centric Design:** ISV revenue tracking optimized for $250K quarterly targets across 20+ partners
- **Commission Intelligence:** Configurable engine handling complex partner revenue models
- **Weekly Integration:** Leverages existing team meeting cadence as primary data input source

**Key Differentiators:**
- **VP Executive Focus:** Dashboard designed specifically for strategic oversight, not operational task management
- **ISV Revenue Specialization:** Purpose-built for technology partner commission structures and sales cycles
- **Hybrid Automation:** Manual task input with automated alerts, due date tracking, and rollover logic
- **Scalable Foundation:** Architecture supports future expansion to AWS/GCP partnership management and potential external sales

**Success Vision:** Transform weekly team meetings from status updates into strategic planning sessions by providing real-time visibility into department performance, pipeline health, and resource optimization opportunities.
