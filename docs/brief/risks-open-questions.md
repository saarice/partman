# Risks & Open Questions

## Key Risks
- **Adoption Risk:** Team may resist transitioning from current informal status update process to structured platform input
- **Data Migration Complexity:** Commission structures and partner agreements may have more complexity than initially understood
- **Technical Scalability:** Local Docker deployment may become limiting factor as data volume grows
- **Integration Pressure:** Demand for Monday.com/HubSpot integration may emerge sooner than planned timeline allows

## Open Questions
- What is the exact data model for commission calculations across different partner types?
- How should the platform handle global time zones for partnership activities?
- What level of historical data migration is required from existing systems?
- How will success be measured beyond revenue tracking?
- What reporting requirements exist for executive leadership above VP level?

## Areas Needing Further Research
- **Partner Agreement Analysis:** Detailed review of all ISV commission structures and calculation methods
- **Current Workflow Documentation:** Map existing team processes for status updates, goal tracking, and pipeline management
- **Competition Research:** Analyze existing partnership management platforms for feature gaps and differentiation opportunities
- **Technical Architecture Deep Dive:** Determine optimal database schema and API design for scalable growth
