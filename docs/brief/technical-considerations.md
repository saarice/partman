# Technical Considerations

## Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Web-based application accessible via modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Browser/OS Support:** Cross-platform compatibility with responsive design for desktop and tablet usage
- **Performance Requirements:** Sub-2 second page load times, support for concurrent team access (5-10 users), real-time dashboard updates

## Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** React.js with clean, minimalist UI framework (Material-UI or similar), responsive design principles
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express or Python/Django for rapid development, RESTful API architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured partnership and revenue data, Redis for caching and session management
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker containerization for local deployment, prepared for cloud migration (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo approach with clear separation between frontend, backend, and database components
- **Service Architecture:** Initially monolithic for MVP simplicity, designed with microservices migration path for scalability
- **Integration Requirements:** API-first design to support future integrations with Monday.com, HubSpot, and partner platforms
- **Security/Compliance:** Role-based access control, secure commission data handling, audit logging for partnership activities
