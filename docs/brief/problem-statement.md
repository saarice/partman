# Problem Statement

As VP Strategic Partnerships managing a 5-person department responsible for $250K quarterly ISV revenue across 20+ technology partners, there are multiple critical visibility gaps:

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Department Visibility Crisis (5/5 priority):** Unable to see real-time team activities, progress toward goals, or resource allocation across AWS/GCP partnerships, ISV sales cycles, and alliance management
- **Pipeline Oversight Blindness (5/5 priority):** ISV opportunities valued at $10K-$1.2M going dark in complex sales cycles (1-3 months), with no systematic tracking of stages from Lead → Demo → POC → Proposal → Closed
- **Commission Complexity:** Manual management of variable commission structures (10-40%, lifetime vs one-time, referral/MSP/reseller models) across diverse partner agreements
- **Goal Tracking Disconnect:** Limited visibility into quarterly/annual ARR progress across technology domains (FinOps, Security, Observability, Backup/DR, Dev Platform)

**Business Impact:**
- Revenue leakage from lost opportunities due to poor pipeline visibility
- Inefficient resource allocation without team activity insights
- Manual commission calculations consuming strategic planning time
- Missed quarterly targets due to lack of systematic goal tracking

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Current tools (Monday, HubSpot) lack integration and ISV-specific workflows
- No unified view combining departmental KPIs with individual partner performance
- Complex technology partnership nuances not captured by generic CRM systems

**Urgency:** With $1M annual revenue responsibility and growing ISV portfolio, systematic pipeline management is essential for scaling department effectiveness and meeting growth targets.
