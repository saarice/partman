## Quality Assurance Strategy

**Testing Approach:**
```javascript
// Testing Strategy Implementation
Backend Testing:
- Unit Tests: Jest + Supertest (>90% coverage)
- Integration Tests: Database testing with Docker containers
- API Tests: Postman collections with automated runs
- Performance Tests: Artillery.js for load testing

Frontend Testing:
- Unit Tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- Component Tests: Storybook for component documentation
- Integration Tests: Testing Library with MSW
- E2E Tests: Cypress for complete user workflows
```

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests pass before code merge
- Code coverage >90% on business logic
- Performance benchmarks met (<2s dashboard load)
- Security scan passes (OWASP Top 10)
- User acceptance testing by VP Strategic Partnerships

## Deployment Strategy

**Environment Progression:**
1. **Development**: Local Docker environment with hot reloading
2. **Testing**: Containerized environment with production data simulation
3. **Staging**: Production-identical environment for final validation
4. **Production**: Local Docker deployment with backup and monitoring

**Deployment Automation:**
```bash
# Automated Deployment Pipeline
1. Code commit to main branch
2. Automated testing suite execution
3. Docker image building and tagging
4. Database migration execution
5. Zero-downtime deployment with health checks
6. Smoke test validation
7. Automated backup verification
```

**Rollback Strategy:**
- Database backup before each deployment
- Container versioning for rapid rollback
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Automated health monitoring with alerting
