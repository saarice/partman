# Product Overview and Objectives

## Executive Summary

The ISV Pipeline Tracker MVP is a containerized Strategic Partnership Resource Optimization Engine designed to transform the VP Strategic Partnerships' ability to manage a 5-person department responsible for $250K quarterly ISV revenue across 20+ technology partners. This Docker-based platform addresses critical visibility gaps in departmental oversight, pipeline tracking, and commission management while providing the foundation for future scaling to AWS/GCP partnership management.

## Primary Objectives

**Business Goals:**
- Achieve consistent $250K quarterly ISV revenue through systematic pipeline management
- Reduce opportunity leakage by 25% through comprehensive tracking and alerts
- Transform weekly team meetings from status collection to strategic planning sessions
- Establish scalable platform architecture supporting future external sales potential

**User Goals:**
- **VP Strategic Partnerships**: Real-time departmental KPIs, pipeline oversight, and resource allocation insights
- **Team Members**: Simplified status reporting, clear individual performance tracking, and automated task management

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
1. **Department Visibility Crisis (Priority: 5/5)**: No real-time visibility into 5-person team activities, progress toward $250K quarterly goals, or resource allocation across AWS/GCP partnerships and ISV sales cycles
2. **Pipeline Oversight Blindness (Priority: 5/5)**: ISV opportunities valued $10K-$1.2M disappearing in 1-3 month sales cycles without systematic stage tracking (Lead → Demo → POC → Proposal → Closed)
3. **Commission Complexity**: Manual management of 10-40% variable structures across lifetime vs one-time, referral/MSP/reseller models
4. **Goal Tracking Disconnect**: Limited quarterly/annual ARR progress visibility across FinOps, Security, Observability, DevOps, and Data Analytics domains

## Solution Approach

**Core Strategy:**
- **Docker-First Architecture**: Simple local deployment with clean, VP-focused UI
- **Pipeline-Centric Design**: ISV revenue tracking optimized for 20+ partners and $250K quarterly targets
- **Commission Intelligence**: Configurable engine handling complex partner revenue models
- **Weekly Integration**: Leverage existing team meeting cadence as primary data input mechanism
