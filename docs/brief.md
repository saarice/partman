# Project Brief: ISV Pipeline Tracker MVP

## Executive Summary

The ISV Pipeline Tracker MVP is a lightweight Docker-based platform designed to provide VP Strategic Partnerships with comprehensive visibility into department performance and ISV revenue pipeline management. The platform addresses critical gaps in departmental oversight and pipeline tracking by consolidating 20+ ISV partner relationships, commission structures, and quarterly revenue goals ($250K target) into a single, clean interface. This MVP serves as proof of concept for a broader partnership management platform while delivering immediate ROI through enhanced visibility and systematic pipeline tracking across FinOps, Security, Observability, DevOps, and Data Analytics domains.

## Problem Statement

As VP Strategic Partnerships managing a 5-person department responsible for $250K quarterly ISV revenue across 20+ technology partners, there are multiple critical visibility gaps:

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Department Visibility Crisis (5/5 priority):** Unable to see real-time team activities, progress toward goals, or resource allocation across AWS/GCP partnerships, ISV sales cycles, and alliance management
- **Pipeline Oversight Blindness (5/5 priority):** ISV opportunities valued at $10K-$1.2M going dark in complex sales cycles (1-3 months), with no systematic tracking of stages from Lead → Demo → POC → Proposal → Closed
- **Commission Complexity:** Manual management of variable commission structures (10-40%, lifetime vs one-time, referral/MSP/reseller models) across diverse partner agreements
- **Goal Tracking Disconnect:** Limited visibility into quarterly/annual ARR progress across technology domains (FinOps, Security, Observability, Backup/DR, Dev Platform)

**Business Impact:**
- Revenue leakage from lost opportunities due to poor pipeline visibility
- Inefficient resource allocation without team activity insights
- Manual commission calculations consuming strategic planning time
- Missed quarterly targets due to lack of systematic goal tracking

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Current tools (Monday, HubSpot) lack integration and ISV-specific workflows
- No unified view combining departmental KPIs with individual partner performance
- Complex technology partnership nuances not captured by generic CRM systems

**Urgency:** With $1M annual revenue responsibility and growing ISV portfolio, systematic pipeline management is essential for scaling department effectiveness and meeting growth targets.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** A containerized Strategic Partnership Resource Optimization Engine that transforms scattered partnership data into actionable intelligence for VP-level decision making.

**Key Approach:**
- **Docker-First Architecture:** Simple deployment on local infrastructure with clean, focused UI
- **Pipeline-Centric Design:** ISV revenue tracking optimized for $250K quarterly targets across 20+ partners
- **Commission Intelligence:** Configurable engine handling complex partner revenue models
- **Weekly Integration:** Leverages existing team meeting cadence as primary data input source

**Key Differentiators:**
- **VP Executive Focus:** Dashboard designed specifically for strategic oversight, not operational task management
- **ISV Revenue Specialization:** Purpose-built for technology partner commission structures and sales cycles
- **Hybrid Automation:** Manual task input with automated alerts, due date tracking, and rollover logic
- **Scalable Foundation:** Architecture supports future expansion to AWS/GCP partnership management and potential external sales

**Success Vision:** Transform weekly team meetings from status updates into strategic planning sessions by providing real-time visibility into department performance, pipeline health, and resource optimization opportunities.

- **Browser/OS Support:** Cross-platform compatibility with responsive design for desktop and tablet usage
- **Performance Requirements:** Sub-2 second page load times, support for concurrent team access (5-10 users), real-time dashboard updates

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** React.js with clean, minimalist UI framework (Material-UI or similar), responsive design principles
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express or Python/Django for rapid development, RESTful API architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured partnership and revenue data, Redis for caching and session management
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker containerization for local deployment, prepared for cloud migration (AWS/GCP/Azure)

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo approach with clear separation between frontend, backend, and database components
- **Service Architecture:** Initially monolithic for MVP simplicity, designed with microservices migration path for scalability
- **Integration Requirements:** API-first design to support future integrations with Monday.com, HubSpot, and partner platforms
- **Security/Compliance:** Role-based access control, secure commission data handling, audit logging for partnership activities

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Bootstrap project with minimal external costs, focus on efficient resource utilization
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for functional MVP development and initial deployment
- **Resources:** Single full-stack developer, VP involvement for requirements validation and user acceptance testing
- **Technical:** Docker deployment on local infrastructure, no immediate cloud hosting requirements

### Key Assumptions

- Team members will adopt new status update workflows with minimal resistance

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Adoption Risk:** Team may resist transitioning from current informal status update process to structured platform input
- **Data Migration Complexity:** Commission structures and partner agreements may have more complexity than initially understood
- **Technical Scalability:** Local Docker deployment may become limiting factor as data volume grows
- **Integration Pressure:** Demand for Monday.com/HubSpot integration may emerge sooner than planned timeline allows

### Open Questions
- What is the exact data model for commission calculations across different partner types?
- How should the platform handle global time zones for partnership activities?
- What level of historical data migration is required from existing systems?
- How will success be measured beyond revenue tracking?
- What reporting requirements exist for executive leadership above VP level?
