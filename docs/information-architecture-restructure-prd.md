## Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview
**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis with comprehensive documentation available

**Current Project State**: ISV Pipeline Tracker MVP - A Strategic Partnership Resource Optimization Engine providing VP Strategic Partnerships with comprehensive visibility into department performance and ISV revenue pipeline management. Currently features executive dashboard, partner management, opportunity tracking, user management (Epic 6 completed), and in-development Epic 7 executive UI design system.

### Available Documentation Analysis
‚úÖ **Document-project analysis available** - using existing comprehensive technical documentation

### Enhancement Scope Definition
**Enhancement Type**: UI/UX Overhaul (Information Architecture restructure)
**Enhancement Description**: Restructure the platform's information architecture to clearly separate analytical dashboards (data consumption) from operational management functions (CRUD operations), creating intuitive navigation that distinguishes between viewing analytics versus managing business objects.
**Impact Assessment**: Significant Impact (substantial existing navigation/routing changes required)

### Goals and Background Context
**Goals**:
‚Ä¢ Separate analytical consumption (dashboards) from operational management (CRUD functions)
‚Ä¢ Create intuitive navigation structure with Dashboard folder containing sub-dashboards
‚Ä¢ Transform opportunity and partner pages into true management interfaces
‚Ä¢ Improve task completion efficiency for both analytics viewing and business operations
‚Ä¢ Maintain all existing functionality while improving information organization

**Background Context**: The current navigation structure mixes analytical dashboards with operational management, creating confusion about whether users are viewing data or managing business objects. This restructure will create clear mental models: Dashboards for viewing/analyzing data, and Management sections for hands-on business operations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
**FR1**: The system shall restructure navigation into two primary sections: "Dashboards" (analytical/reporting) and "Management" (operational/CRUD functions) while preserving all existing functionality.

**FR2**: The Dashboards section shall contain sub-pages: Overall Dashboard (executive KPIs), Opportunities Dashboard (pipeline analytics), Partnerships Dashboard (partner performance), and Financial Dashboard (revenue/commissions).

**FR3**: The Management section shall contain: Opportunity Management (CRUD operations for opportunities) and Partnership Management (partner lifecycle operations) with enhanced hands-on editing capabilities.

**FR4**: The current opportunity page analytics/charts shall be moved to "Opportunities Dashboard" while new CRUD interface shall be created in "Opportunity Management".

**FR5**: All existing dashboard components, charts, and analytics shall be preserved and accessible through the new Dashboards navigation structure.

**FR6**: URL routing shall implement automatic redirects from old navigation paths to new structure to preserve bookmarks and external links.

**FR7**: The navigation system shall maintain Epic 7 executive design system consistency with professional appearance and responsive behavior.

### Non-Functional Requirements
**NFR1**: Navigation restructure must maintain existing performance characteristics with page load times under 2 seconds for all reorganized sections.

**NFR2**: The restructure must preserve all existing user permissions and role-based access control without requiring user re-authentication.

**NFR3**: All existing Epic 7 design system components, theming, and visual consistency must be maintained throughout the navigation restructure.

**NFR4**: The new information architecture must be intuitive enough that existing users can adapt without training, with clear visual distinctions between Dashboard and Management sections.

**NFR5**: Mobile responsiveness must be preserved across all reorganized navigation elements and page structures.

### Compatibility Requirements
**CR1**: All existing APIs and backend services must remain unchanged - this is purely a frontend navigation and organization restructure.

**CR2**: Database schema compatibility must be maintained completely - no data structure changes required for this enhancement.

**CR3**: UI/UX consistency with Epic 7 executive design system must be preserved, including color palette, typography, and component library usage.

**CR4**: Integration compatibility with existing user management (Epic 6), partner management, and opportunity tracking functionality must be maintained without modification.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
The navigation restructure will integrate seamlessly with the existing Epic 7 executive design system by utilizing existing navigation components, maintaining professional executive aesthetic, leveraging Material-UI 5+ components with executive theme tokens, and preserving light/dark theme functionality.

### Modified/New Screens and Views
- **New Dashboard Container**: Create dashboard landing page with navigation to four sub-dashboards
- **Enhanced Management Pages**: Transform existing pages into dedicated CRUD interfaces
- **Reorganized Navigation Structure**: Modify primary navigation to separate "üìä Dashboards" from "‚öôÔ∏è Management"
- **Breadcrumb Enhancement**: Extend breadcrumb system for hierarchical navigation

### UI Consistency Requirements
All new UI elements must use existing design system components, maintain Epic 7 visual hierarchy, preserve existing navigation patterns, and ensure responsive behavior across reorganized structure.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript 5.3+, JavaScript ES2022
**Frameworks**: React 18.2+, Material-UI 5.14+, Express.js 4.18+
**Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Redis 7.2+ caching
**Infrastructure**: Docker Compose 2.0+, nginx load balancer
**External Dependencies**: Chart.js 4.4+, D3.js 7.8+, Framer Motion 10.16+, React Router v6.18+

### Integration Approach
**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- Restructure React Router v6 routes while maintaining all existing page components
- Reorganize navigation components using existing Material-UI patterns
- Implement URL redirect mapping for backward compatibility
- Preserve Epic 7 design system integration throughout restructure

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: Breaking bookmarked URLs, user confusion, React Router conflicts
**Mitigation Strategies**: URL redirect mapping, feature flags for rollout/rollback, user education, extensive testing

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Single comprehensive epic** - represents one cohesive user experience change affecting navigation throughout the platform.

## Epic 9: Information Architecture Restructure - Analytics vs Management Separation
