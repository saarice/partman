5. getPipelineMetrics() ‚Üí `/dashboard/pipeline`
6. getTeamPerformance() ‚Üí `/dashboard/team`

**Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
async getKPIs() {
  try {
    const response = await api.get('/dashboard/kpis');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API error, using fallback data');

## üìù PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### Story 11.6 - Remove Technical Debt
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Remaining Work:** Low priority cleanup

**What Was Found:**
- 46 console.log statements in frontend (mostly debugging)

## üîß TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### 1. API Integration Pattern
**Decision:** Try real API first, fallback to mock data on error

**Rationale:**
- Provides resilience during development
- Allows frontend work when backend is down
- Maintains user experience
- Easy to remove fallback for production

### 2. JWT Secret Handling
**Decision:** Require JWT_SECRET in environment, no defaults

**Rationale:**
- Prevents accidental production deployment with defaults
- Forces developers to set proper secrets
- Fail-fast prevents security issues
- Clear error messages guide setup

### 3. Commission Service Architecture
**Decision:** Centralized service with comprehensive validation

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth for business logic
- Easy to test in isolation
- Validation prevents data corruption
- Extensible for future commission types

### 4. CI/CD Job Structure
**Decision:** 8 parallel/sequential jobs with quality gates

**Rationale:**
- Parallel execution for speed
- Sequential dependencies where needed
- Comprehensive coverage of quality aspects
- Clear visibility into what failed
